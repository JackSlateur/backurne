# backurne

`backurne` is a handy tool for backuping RBD's image on RBD.\
Yep ! What is better, for backuping a Ceph cluster, than another Ceph cluster ?


It does not do much by itself, though, but orchestrate and relies heavily on other tools.\
It has a fine integration with Proxmox, but is able to backup "plain" (or "raw RBD") cluster as well.

Supported features
---
- **Snapshot-based backup**, with no agent strictly required on the VM.
- Backup inspection and restoration via **command line interface** as well as via **REST API**.
- **Support multiple retention policy** efficiently (both in term of storage and network bandwidth), dynamically configurable per host (proxmox-only) via REST API.
- Auto cleanup : deletion is never generated by a human, thus **no human mistakes**.
- **Compression** and **encryption** "on the wire" for enhanced efficiency and security.
- Peaceful integration with other snapshots (via Proxmox web interface or whatever).
- Multiple cluster support, with mixed type ("proxmox" and "plain").
- A couple of backups can be stored on the live clusters, for faster recovery.
- Optional **fsfreeze** support (proxmox-only) via Qemu-quest-agent.
- Backup deactivation via Proxmox's web interface.
- External custom processing via hooks

- VM tracking, for those who uses a single Proxmox cluster with multiple Ceph backend.

Encryption and compression at rest are also seamlessly supported via Bluestore OSDs (see https://ceph.com/community/new-luminous-bluestore/)

Required packages
---

Core: python (>=3.6), python3-dateutil, python3-termcolor, python3-prettytable, python3-requests, python3-proxmoxer, python3-anytree (from https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree, .deb for buster attached for convenience) \
For mapping (optional): kpartx, rbd-nbd (luminous or later)\
For the REST API: python3-flask, python3-flask-autoindex\
For bash autocompletion: jq


Installation
---

 - Check out the **Authentification** parts.
 - Clone the source, edit the configuration
 - Setup a Ceph cluster, used to store the backups
 - Profit ?

Configuration
---

See [custom.conf.sample](custom.conf.sample)

Authentification, and where should I run what
---

`backurne` interacts with the backup cluster via the `rbd` command line. It must have the required configuration at /etc/ceph/ceph.conf and the needed keyring.\
It is assumed that `backurne` will be run on a Ceph node (perhaps a monitor), but this is not strictly required (those communications will not be encrypted nor compressed).

`backurne` connects to proxmox's cluster via their HTTP API. No data is exchanged via this link, it is purely used for "control" (listing VM, listing disks, fetching informations etc).

`backurne` connects to every "live" Ceph clusters via SSH. For each cluster, it will connect to a single node, always the same, defined in Proxmox (and / or overwritten via the configuration).\
SSH authentification nor authorization is **not** handled by `backurne` in any way.\
It is up to you to configure ssh : either accept or ignore the host keys, place your public key on the required hosts etc.

Command line interface
---

See [cli.md](cli.md)

REST API

See [api.md](api.md)

Used technology
---

 - `RBD` is the core technology used by `backurne` : it provides snapshot export, import, diff, mapping etc.
 - `ssh` is used to transfert the snapshots between the live clusters and the backup cluster. `RBD` can be manipulated over TCP/IP, but without encryption nor compression, thus this solution was not kept.
 - `xxhash` (or other, see the configuration) is used to check the consistancy between snapshots.
 - `rbd-nbd` is used to map a specific backup and inspect its content.
 - `kpartx` is used to explode partition tables into multiple block devices.


Note
---
On Proxmox, LXC is not yet supported. Only Qemu so far :/

The project is developed mainly for Debian Buster and Proxmox, and is used here on these technologies.\
The "plain" feature as well as running `backurne` on other operating system is less tested, and may be less bug-proof.\
Bug report, merge requests and feature requests are welcome : some stuff are not implemented simply because I do not need them, not because it cannot be done nor because I do not want to code them.
